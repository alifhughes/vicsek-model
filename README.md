### C++ Vicsek particle simulation model using MPI

This project is to re-create the Vicsek particle simulation model in C++ both serially and multi-procces using MPI. Vicsek model simulates the collective motion of particles when they interact, similar to flocking behaviour. More info found here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicsek_model)
